Nice to meet you.

I am a frontend developer with websites and web applications building experience. I specialize in JavaScript and have experience working with React and Node.js. 

I am currently in retraining as a software developer at BBQ Baumann Bildung & Qualifizierung and looking for internship from 03/2023.

I'm a fast learner and can take on any challenge creatively.

I believe I'd make a valuable asset as an intern. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
